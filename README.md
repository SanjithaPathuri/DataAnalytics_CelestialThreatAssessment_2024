## Project Title: Enhancing Network Security Through Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection

## File Structure:
src folder includes the notebook files(code) for different datasets:
1. Project Code for Training Dataset.
2. Project Code for Testing Dataset.

data folder includes the 'UNSW-NB15 dataset' containing the different parts of the dataset:
1. NUSW-NB15_features - Describes the Features in the Dataset
2. UNSW-NB15_testing-set - 82,332 records in the testing set
3. UNSW-NB15_training-set (in .zip as filesize>25MB) - 175,341 records in the training set 

doc folder includes the documentation of the project:
1. Project Proposal
2. Intermediate Project Report
3. Final Project Report
4. Final Project Presentation

Both of the Python notebooks of the project source code were run primarily on the Local System's Juypter Notebook, as well as in the Google Colab.

The Project contains two different jupyter notebooks implemented for each dataset i.e., Training and Testing Dataset, Which Can Be Implemented in a Single file, But due to GPU and CPU constraints, and also for making it more easier to implement. It has been split into two different notebooks.
